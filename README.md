# orsum
orsum, which stands for over-representation summary, is a tool for the summary of enriched terms resulting from one or more enrichment analyses. orsum works on hierarchical annotations, e.g. GO and REACTOME, and finds representative terms to summarize the results by applying rules based on subterm-superterm relations.<br>

As input, orsum requires a <a href=https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMT:_Gene_Matrix_Transposed_file_format_.28.2A.gmt.29>GMT file</a> contaning the gene sets, and one or more files containing the enriched term IDs.<br>

The subterm-superterm relations among terms are inferred from the GMT file. The GMT file for the annotations can be found from multiple sources, for consistency, if it is available, it is better to download the exact GMT file that is used in enrichment analysis. If you already use <a href=https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost>g:Profiler</a> for enrichment or GMT file was not available from your enrichment tool, getting from <a href=https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/static/gprofiler_hsapiens.name.zip>this g:Profiler data source link</a> is an option. This zip file contains GMT for Reactome, GO:BP, GO:MF and GO:CC which you can use with orsum.<br><br>
The input files containing the enriched term IDs (e.g. GO:0008150 or REAC:R-HSA-1640170) must contain one ID per line and must be sorted, with the most significant term at top. There should not be a header.<br>

The user can specify which rules to apply, their order, and the maximum size for a term to be used as a representative term.<br>

The terms initially get their rank based on their order in the input file and each is a representative term (representing only itself).
Throughout the orsum run, the representative terms get their rank from the best ranked term they represent, and the resulting terms are ordered by this rank.<br>

orsum produces multiple files as output:<br>
<ul>
	<li> An HTML file which presents the summarized results - the list of representative terms - with an option to click on each term to see the represented terms.
	<li> Two TSV files (-Summary.tsv, -Detailed.tsv) which contain the information in the HTML file in different formats, with some extras, like term size. -Summary.tsv file contains only representative terms while -Detailed.tsv additionally contains representative terms. -Summary.tsv file is very useful for getting an overview when comparing multiple enrichment results.
	<li> Three figures for<br>
		<ul>
			<li> the representative terms and how many terms they represent
			<li> the ranks of the representative terms (for each enrichment result if multiple enrichment results are input)
			<li> represented term size vs rank of representative terms <br>
		</ul>
</ul>
<br>

In order to use the tool you can either download the .py files from this repository and run orsum.py or you can download from bioconda.<br>
<code>
conda install -c bioconda orsum
</code><br>
<br>
<br>
Usage:
<br>
<code>
orsum.py [-h] --gmt GMT --files FILES [FILES ...]
                [--outputFolder OUTPUTFOLDER] [--maxRepSize MAXREPSIZE]
                [--minTermSize MINTERMSIZE] [--rules [RULES [RULES ...]]]
                [--numberOfTermsToPlot NUMBEROFTERMSTOPLOT] [--outputAll]
</code>
<br>
<ul>
<li>--gmt: Path of the GMT file. (required)
<li>--files: Paths of the enrichment result files. (required)
<li>--outputFolder: Path of the output result files. If it is not specified, results are written to the current directory. (optional, default=".")
<li>--maxRepSize: The maximum size of a representative term. Terms bigger than this size will not be discarded but also will not be able to represent terms smaller than this size. (optional, default=2000)
<li>--minTermSize: The minimum size of the terms to be processed. Smaller terms will be discarded. (optional, default=10)
<li>--rules: List of ordered numbers of the rules to apply while summarizing. (optional, by default all the rules are run from 1 to 5)
<li>--numberOfTermsToPlot: The number of representative terms to be presented in barplot and heatmap. (optional, default=50)
<li>--outputAll: When this option is used, a summary file is created after applying each rule, otherwise only final summary is created. (optional)


</ul>
<br>

Example command:<br>
<code>
orsum.py --gmt 'hsapiens.GO:BP.name.gmt' --files 'Enrichment-GOBP.csv' --outputFolder 'OutputGOBP'
</code><br>


Example command:<br>
<code>
orsum.py --gmt 'hsapiens.REAC.name.gmt' --files 'Enrichment-Method1-Reac.csv' 'Enrichment-Method2-Reac.csv' 'Enrichment-Method3-Reac.csv' --outputFolder 'OutputReac' --maxRepSize 1000 --minTermSize 20 --rules 1 2 3 --numberOfTermsToPlot 20 --outputAll
</code><br>

The rules are given below:
<ol>
	<li> Super &lt;- Sub (w worse rank) || Superterms will represent their less significant (worse ranked) subterms. This includes equal terms, i.e. the terms that annotate exactly the same set of genes.
	<li> Sub &lt;- Super (w worse rank, subterm is 75% of superterm) || Subterms will represent their less significant  superterms if subterm gene set constitutes 75% of the superterm gene set.
	<li> Sub &lt;- Super (w worse rank less representative power) || Subterms will represent their less significant and with less representative power superterms.
	<li> Common Super &lt;- (Sub Sub) (w less representative power) || Pairs of subterms will be represented by their common superterms that have more representative power.
	<li> Large Super &lt;- Large Sub || Superterms with gene sets exceeding the maximum representative term size threshold will represent their less significant subterms with gene set also exceeding this threshold. This allows selecting one broad term as representative term for the other associated broad terms.
</ol>
